## FL-Colab — *FakersLab fork for Google Colab*

This project provides you IPython Notebook to use FakersLab with Google Colaboratory.  
You can create your own AI video even if you don’t have a powerful GPU on your local desktop PC.

Keep in mind that working within remote cloud servers like Colab imposes some restrictions.  
Because of this, working with Fakers-Colab is not so convenient as working with FakersLab directly on your computer.

Fakers-Colab uses FakersLab and to understand the workflow, you should first understand the FakersLab workflow.
