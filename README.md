## DFL-Colab — *FakersLab fork for Google Colab*

This project provides you IPython Notebook to use FakersLab with Google Colaboratory.  
You can create your DF video even if you don’t have a powerful GPU on a desktop PC.

Keep in mind that working with a remote server imposes some restrictions.  
Because of this, working with FakersColab is not so convenient as working with FakersLab directly on your computer.

FakersColab uses FakersLab and to understand the workflow, you should first understand the FakersLab workflow.
